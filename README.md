# UNKLAND
A Survival game made for HaxeJam22 <br>
Which i didn't submit because itch.io is garbage shite <br>
Also big shotouts to git for being buggy shit <br>

Newgrounds release in some time? <br>
Because of this i have zero motivation to continue this project. <br>
Many hours into nothing. <br>

The only thing that i learnt from this is release the game 1 day before the deadline of the gamejam <br>
Gonna take a break from coding maybe because this shit made me feel nothing <br>
I'm not depressed though
