originally for haxejam22 <br>
but itch.io did not told me what to fucking do to submit a game INTO the jam... <br>
so here's a game that i have worked for like 4 days started in 25.07.2022 <br>

so here's a message to git, for being buggy as fuck!
## FUCK YOU GIT
and a message to itch.io
## FUCK YOU ITCH.IO
